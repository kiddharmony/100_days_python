# Day 2 - Tip Calculator Project

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, 15? "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

# Project Code
tip_percentage = (1 + tip / 100)
cost_share = (bill / people) * tip_percentage
final_split = (round(cost_share, 2))
# print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_split}")
print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_split:.2f}") # ":.2f" is a format specifier to display trailing zeros two decimals for f-strings
# print(f"Each person should pay: $%.2f" % cost_share) # "%.2f" in place of round works to print trailing zero
